# S3: use Intelligent-Tiering

The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier. For a small monthly charge, S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and automatically moves objects that have not been accessed for a long time to lower-cost access tiers.
