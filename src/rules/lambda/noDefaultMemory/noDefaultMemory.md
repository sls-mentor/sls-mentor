# Lambda: No Default Memory (no-default-memory)

Lambda Functions memory is configurable and should be configured for the use-case.
This can impact the speed and running cost of the Lambda Function.

> **Note:** Any increase in memory size triggers an equivalent increase in CPU available to your function

---

## Suggested Actions:

First, find out how much memory is needed for a specific lambda. 
- you can cook into your CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda function to find the value of `Max Memory Used`. [For more information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/best-practices.html)

    ```
- To automate this task, use a power-tune tool such as [aws-lambda-power-tuning](https://github.com/alexcasalboni/aws-lambda-power-tuning)
