# Async Lambdas: specify a failure destination

Async calls to lambdas don't provide any response to the resource that preformed them.

That's why there should always be a failure destination specified for all your asynchronous Lambda, in order to be able to process the potential failure of any call.
A DLQ can also be configured to receive failed executions.

## How to fix the issue

Here are resources to help you solve the issue on your project and define a failure fallback on a lambda.
